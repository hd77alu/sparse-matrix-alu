# Project Overview
This is a JavaScript project That can Load two sparse matrices from an input file & Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on the matrices based on the user choice.
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/hd77alu/sparse-matrix-alu
```
- Navigate to the sourse code by using `cd dsa/sparse_matrix/code/src/`
- Sample inputs are avilable inside `dsa/sparse_matrix/sample_inputs`
- To run the project inside the `code/src` directory use:
```
node matrix-operations.js
```
- The User Interface will be displayed as follow:
```
Select an operation:
 1.addition
 2.subtraction
 3.multiplication
 Your choice: 
Enter your first matrix file pathaway:
Enter your second matrix file pathway:
```
- Three matrix sample files are avilable inside the `sample_inputs` with the following paths:
- `../../sample_inputs/matrix_sample_1.txt`
- `../../sample_inputs/matrix_sample_2.txt`
- `../../sample_inputs/matrix_sample_3.txt`
- sample 1 & 2 are eligible for addition/substraction
- sample 3 is eligible for multiplication with the both of the samples.
